## A photoshop\-like BEVEL EFFECT in VB

### Description

This program takes a bitmap image and applies a bevel effect to it, adding hilights and shadows to make it appear 3-D.

The direction and elevation of the light can be changed, as can the size of the bevel.

Includes a "debug" mode which shows the process step-by-step (see screenshot)

Some of the calculations have been converted to integer calculations for speed. Others still use floating-point, this is one future optimization that I might do.
 
### More Info
 
The code uses the cDibBitmap class for www.vbaccelerator.com

Error checking is minimal.
